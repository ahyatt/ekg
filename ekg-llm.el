;;; Commentary:
;; ekg-llm provides a way to interact with a language model using prompts that
;; are stored in ekg, and able to provide output to ekg notes. Notes can have
;; certain prompts associated with them by using "magic tags".
;;
;; This currently only works with Open AI's API, but could be extended to work
;; with others that also offer an API and a way to have structured return
;; values.
