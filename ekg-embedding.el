;;; Commentary:
;; This is a module for creating, storing, and using embeddings in ekg. The
;; embeddings provide the capability of understanding note and tag similarity,
;; as well as searching via embedding.
;;
;; It is highly recommended that you byte-compile this, or, better yet,
;; native-compile this, due to the amount of calculations that happen.
