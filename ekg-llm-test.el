;;; Commentary:

;; These tests should be run and pass before every commit to ekg-llm.

;;; Code:
(require 'ekg)
(require 'ekg-llm)

(defun ekg-llm-test-replace-text (markers text)
  "Replace text between MARKERS."
  (let ((beg (car markers))
        (end (cdr markers)))
    (goto-char beg)
    (delete-region beg end)
    (insert text)))

(ert-deftest ekg-llm-test-create-output-holder ()
  (with-temp-buffer
    (let ((markers (ekg-llm-create-output-holder "BEGIN" "END")))
      (should (equal "BEGIN\n\nEND\n"
                     (substring-no-properties (buffer-string))))
